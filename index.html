              <ul>
                <li>Where to go?</li>

        <h3>Tethered</h3>
        <a href="#"><img src="./assets/img/dock-rope.jpeg" alt="rope on dock"></a>

          <p>The sands are many and the land vast. But, to the dock, as in often times, the wonderer turns the course. And as he walks, his feet tangle in the ropes. Tethered, yet, now free.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Untie it?</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaQYQnrPgSM" target="_blank">To never be tethered.</a></li>

      <h3>Blue Boat</h3>

        <a href="#"><img src="./assets/img/blue-boat-docked.jpeg" alt="blue boat at dock"></a>
        <p>The wonderer slips inside the boat, blue as the morning, and listens to the water. There were oars. But they weren't needed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pguMUFyJ3_U" target="_blank">Only dreams.</a> And the boat begins to move.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where?</li>
          <li>A wonder.</li>

      <h3>Lone Sailing</h3>

      <a href="#"><img src="./assets/img/lone-blue-boat.jpg" alt="lone boat in ocean water"></a>
      <p>He sings, "Though as a lone sailor, there's a place for me...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLx_7wEmwms" target="_blank">out there.</a>" By and by the waves smoothly roll and his path is sure.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>And the ocean knows?</li>
          <li>To the dreamer's dream.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <h3>Found</h3>

      <a href="#"><img src="./assets/img/old-boats-cove.jpg" alt="old boats in cove"></a>
      <p>To the eastern shore, upon the white sands. The journey ends. His rest is found.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To where has the wonderer gone?</li>
          <li>Where ever the blue boat takes him.</li>
          <li>And where it takes him is where his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U016JWYUDdQ" target="_blank">dreams come true.</a></li>

      <h3>Dream</h3>
        <a href="#"><img src="./assets/img/lone-boat.jpeg" target="_blank" alt="loan boat in ocean"></a>
      <p>There's always a dream to live. There's always a place to find. There's always that mile to walk and the mountain to climb.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What's your dream?</li>
