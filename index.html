    </div>
      <h3>Morning</h3>
        <p>The morning greets a wondering soul. The day of all days is here. Alas, off to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM6VcGCN6UI" target="_blank">seize the morning.</a>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where to go?</li>
          <li>Where the wind blows.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Tethered</h3>
        <p>The sands are many and the land vast. But, to the dock, as in often times, the wonderer turns the course. And as he walks, his feet tangle in the ropes. Tethered, yet, now free.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Untie it?</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaQYQnrPgSM" target="_blank">To never be tethered.</a></li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Blue Boat</h3>
        <p>The wonderer slips inside the boat, blue as the morning, and listens to the water. There is no oar. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pguMUFyJ3_U" target="_blank">Only dreams.</a> And the boat begins to move.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where?</li>
          <li>A wonder.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Lone Sailing</h3>
        <p>He sings, "Though as a lone sailor, there's a place for me...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLx_7wEmwms" target="_blank">out there.</a>" By and by the waves smoothly roll and his path is sure.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>And the ocean knows?</li>
            <li>To the dreamer's dream.</li>
          </ul>

    <h3>Found</h3>
      <p>To the eastern shore, upon the white sands. The journey ends. His rest is found.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To where has the wonderer gone?</li>
          <li>Where ever the blue boat takes him.</li>
          <li>And where it takes him is where his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U016JWYUDdQ" target="_blank">dreams come true.</a></li>
        </ul>
